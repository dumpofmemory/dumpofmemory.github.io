#### Working with flex items that have widths and wrap onto new lines or columns with flex-wrap.

<p>
The nature of Flexbox is that its gonna try to work with the width you've given but if it doesn't work out, then first of all it's gonna
try to evenly distribute the width throughout the children ?or? </p>

<p><strong>flex-wrap</strong> is the property that is assigned to a flex container. and default value is <strong>nowrap</strong>.</p>

<p>What happened in the pic above is that <strong>flex-wrap</strong> actually works with <strong>width: 300px;</strong> now. We've got three elements on the screen before we ran out of space and it breaks onto the next line. And the hight of the elements has splitted amongst them.</p>
<p>By default, (before we applied <strong>flex-wrap: wrap;</strong>) flex-items will try to stretch their way across the flex container (and that's also because we have applied <strong>height: 100vh</strong>. Otherwise it will look like the image below)</p>

<p>And when we turn the wrap on, it sort of says: "Okay, so we need to stretch across our container, but we also need to split it up between the ten of us"</p>

 <p>When applying <strong>flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;</strong> the main axis stays the same but the cross axis instead of going top-to-bottom is reversed to bottom-to-top</p>

<p>Speaking about filling in the space. This works similar to every other box model. Changing width to percentage will make the work.</p>

<p>In the pic above, because we have the height a 100vh set on it (the height is kind of this goldrenrod border across), the items can no longer fit in. So it wraps around vertically because we have switched the main axis from going left-to-right to up-to-bottom by appying <strong>flex-direction: column;</strong> to the flex  container. </p>

<p>If we change to <strong>min-height:100vh;</strong> it never reaches that point where it has to wrap even with hundred flex-items in the container. </p>

<p><strong>Margin is not part of the box model!</strong> Which means, when we add 10px margin + width: 33.3333333% (10px margin is gonna be added to each side of the item), it's not gonna fit so it breaks</p>

When using <strong>calc(33.3333333% - 20px)</strong> because it's 10px margin on each side, it will automatically resize to your needs.

<p>If we change to <strong>padding: 10px;</strong> it's gonna fix it. Because we use here <strong>box-sizing: border-box</strong>. And <strong>both padding and border are parts of the box model</strong>, whereas margin is not.</p>
