### Up and running with Flexbox. Understanding display:flex; and the relationship between flex container and the flex items.

> display: inline-flex;

Flex container in this case is similar to span or other inline elements and only takes as much width as is needed and will kind of wrap around the content.

> display: flex;

Flex container in this case goes all the way across the entire page and in that way is similar to block level elements.

> height: 100vh;

vh stands for viewport height. and it will make the container stretch the entire height. it is kind of like height: 100%, however when we resize the window vertically we do not have to worry about any 100% hacks
