That's how I discovered couple of useful commands for the future instances.
<code>which create-react-app</code>
<code>npm uninstall -g create-react-app</code>
<code>yarn global remove create-react-app</code>
<code>npm cache clean --force</code>
<code>npm cache verify</code>

```
âžœ  zeapp which create-react-app                      

/usr/local/bin/create-react-app

âžœ  zeapp npm uninstall -g create-react-app

âžœ  zeapp npm cache clean --force

npm WARN using --force I sure hope you know what you are doing.

âžœ  zeapp npm cache verify

```
Then I  dedcided to remove zeapp, then cd ../ back to Desktop and tried again from the scratch.
<code>npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript</code>

This time the project was successfully created.

That's all folks!
