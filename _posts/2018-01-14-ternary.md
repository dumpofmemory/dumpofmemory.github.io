```javascript
a == b ? console.log("Match!") : console.log("No match!");
```
if condition <code>a</code> equals <code>b</code> is true, then do one thing, else do something else. The Ternary Operator makes this into a single line of code for us where it says the condition, question mark, the true statement, colon, the false statement.
So, if <code>a</code> equals <code>b</code> is true, then console log match. Otherwise, console log no match.
