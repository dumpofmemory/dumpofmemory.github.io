title: Basic Data Structures Remove Items Using splice()
categories: freeCodeCamp
---

Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. <code>splice()</code> allows us to do just that: **remove any number of consecutive elements** from anywhere in an array.

<code>splice()</code> can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

```javascript
let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
// array now equals ['today', 'was', 'great']
```

<code>splice()</code> not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:
```javascript

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray equals ['really', 'happy']
```


## Task
We've defined a function, sumOfTen, which takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of that array's elements. Modify the function, using splice(), so that it returns a value of 10.

```javascript
function sumOfTen(arr) {
  // change code below this line

  // change code above this line
  return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(sumOfTen([2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1]));

```

### Task Conditions to be satisfied
- sumOfTen should return 10
- The sumOfTen function should utilize the splice() method


## Solution
```javascript
function sumOfTen(arr) {
  // change code below this line
  arr.splice(1,2);
  // change code above this line
  return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(sumOfTen([2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1]));

```

# Basic Data Structures: Add Items Using splice()

Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, we can go one step further with splice() — in addition to removing elements, we can use that third parameter, which represents one or more elements, to add them as well. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. For instance, let's say you're storing a color scheme for a set of DOM elements in an array, and want to dynamically change a color based on some action:
```javascript
function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {
  arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);
  return arr;
}

let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];

colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');
// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place
// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
```

This function takes an array of hex values, an index at which to remove an element, and the new color to replace the removed element with. The return value is an array containing a newly modified color scheme! While this example is a bit oversimplified, we can see the value that utilizing splice() to its maximum potential can have.


## Task

We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.

```javascript
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line

  // change code above this line
  return arr;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));
```

### Task Conditions to be satisfied
- htmlColorNames should return ["DarkSalmon", "BlanchedAlmond", "LavenderBlush", "PaleTurqoise", "FireBrick"]
- The htmlColorNames function should utilize the splice() method
- You should not use shift() or unshift().
- You should not use array bracket notation.


## Solution
```javascript
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line
  arr.splice(0,2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond');
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));
```

# Basic Data Structures: Copy Array Items Using slice()
The next method we will cover is slice(). slice(), rather than modifying an array, copies, or extracts, a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:
```javascript
let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather equals ['snow', 'sleet'];
// weatherConditions still equals ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']
```

In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

##  Task
We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the elements 'warm' and 'sunny'.

```javascript
function forecast(arr) {
  // change code below this line

  return arr;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));
```

### Task Conditions to be satisfied
- forecast should return ["warm", "sunny"]
- The forecast function should utilize the slice() method

## Solution
```javascript
function forecast(arr) {
  // change code below this line
  arr = arr.slice(2,4);
  return arr;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));
```

# Basic Data Structures: Copy an Array with the Spread Operator

While <code>slice()</code> allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new *spread operator* allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: <code>...</code>

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
```javascript
let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
// thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]
// thisArray remains unchanged, and is identical to thatArray
```

## Task

We have defined a function, <code>copyMachine</code> which takes <code>arr</code> (an array) and <code>num</code> (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of <code>num</code> copies of <code>arr</code>. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).

```javascript
function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // change code below this line

    // change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

// change code here to test different cases:
console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));
```

### Task Conditions to be satisfied
- copyMachine([true, false, true], 2) should return [[true, false, true], [true, false, true]]
- copyMachine([1, 2, 3], 5) should return [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
- copyMachine([true, true, null], 1) should return [[true, true, null]]
- copyMachine(["it works"], 3) should return [["it works"], ["it works"], ["it works"]]
- The copyMachine function should utilize the spread operator with array arr

## Solution
```javascript
function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // change code below this line
    newArr.push([...arr]);
    // change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

// change code here to test different cases:
console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));
```

# Basic Data Structures: Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator
Another huge advantage of the spread operator, is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

```javascript
let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
// thatArray now equals ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander']
```
Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

## Task
We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence, modify the function using the spread operator so that it returns the array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].

```javascript
function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence; // change this line
  return sentence;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(spreadOut());
```

### Task Conditions to be satisfied
- spreadOut should return ["learning", "to", "code", "is", "fun"]
- The spreadOut function should utilize spread syntax

## Solution
```javascript
function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence = ['learning', ...fragment, 'is', 'fun']; // change this line
  return sentence;
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(spreadOut());
```
